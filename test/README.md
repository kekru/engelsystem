# Test files
Be sure to place your Testfiles in [test/model](model).  
If you need an other folder, define it in test/phpunit.xml  

The Name must be *Test.php (with an uppercase T).  

Inside the File define a class also called *Test.php,  
e.g. class LogEntries_model_Test extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {...}
